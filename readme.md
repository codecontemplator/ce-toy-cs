# About this repo
**ce-toy-cs** is an attempt to bring the [the original haskell prototype ce-toy](https://github.com/codecontemplator/ce-toy) to the dotnet world. 
But not only that, it also continues the journey, for example, by providing primitives for lifting single applicant rule expressions to multiple applicants.
